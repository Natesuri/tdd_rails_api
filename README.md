Building a rails api with test driven development (TDD / BDD) and continuous integration (CI).

Understanding the importance of testing in real world application development, I set out to make an application following test driven developement best practices and setting up continuous integration on my GitHub repo.

I will use Rspec for Rails Testing and will likely use CircleCI for continuous integration.
